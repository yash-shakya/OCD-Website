          <h3>Connected 400+ Members</h3>
          <p>
            Our society has successfully built a vibrant and dynamic community
            of over 400 members. These individuals are passionate about solving
            complex problems in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and
            Competitive Programming (CP). Our members engage in regular
            discussions, coding challenges, and collaborative learning sessions,
            which have significantly enhanced their skills and contributed to
            our collective success.
          </p>
          <p>
            By creating a supportive environment for growth, we've enabled our
            members to tackle real-world problems, participate in competitive
            coding events, and achieve personal milestones in their coding
            journeys.

          <h3>Active Participation in Hackathons</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the year, our members actively participate in various
            hackathons, both local and national. These events serve as a
            platform for showcasing their coding skills, innovative ideas, and
            problem-solving abilities. Our team consistently performs well,
            often securing top positions and accolades, which underscores our
            commitment to excellence and innovation.

            Hackathons not only provide an opportunity for practical application
            of skills but also foster teamwork, creativity, and a spirit of
            competition among our members. Each event brings new challenges and
            learning experiences, contributing to our growth and success.
