We foster a collaborative environment where members can refine their problem-solving skills and learn from each other's approaches through daily DSA discussions, CP discussions, and Development Projects, thereby promoting mutual growth and innovation.

        Second and third-year members will mentor new juniors, fostering a collaborative environment for project development and research. The ongoing projects at OCD are mentored by dedicated seniors who provide guidance and support to the members. Under their mentorship, many members have made their first pull request (PR) and gained valuable experience in real-world software development. This mentorship program fosters a collaborative environment where members can learn from experienced seniors and contribute to meaningful projects. It serves as a platform for skill development and encourages members to explore new technologies and ideas.
