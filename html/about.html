          Second and third-year members will mentor new juniors, fostering a

          guidance and support to the members. Under their mentorship, many
          members have made their first pull request (PR) and gained valuable
          experience in real-world software development. This mentorship program
          fosters a collaborative environment where members can learn from
          experienced seniors and contribute to meaningful projects. It serves
